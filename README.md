# Step Sequencer

This application is an analog step sequencer simulation built on the [Web Audio API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html). It is loosely based on the architecture of a [ARP Sequencer](http://www.vintagesynth.com/arp/arpseq.php) and is not intended to be a replication, so don't tell me how lame a reproduction it is!
