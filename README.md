# Step Sequencer

This application is an analog step sequencer built on the [Web Audio API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html). It is based on the [ARP Sequencer](http://www.vintagesynth.com/arp/arpseq.php).

## Setup

In theory, you should be able to just clone the repo and run 
```npm install```
